    "- **`code_station`:** field present in the JSON response that identifies the station associated with each observation.\n",
    "- **In practice, to obtain a clean time series for a station, you must use the full station code (e.g., `F700000102`) as the value of the `code_entite` parameter in the request.**\n",
    "- **In the response, the `code_station` field allows you to verify that all observations indeed come from the requested station.**\n",
    "- **Thus, each observation is associated with a unique timestamp for the selected station, which ensures an exploitable time series.**\n"
